					<p>The first logo’s light blue and some shades of blue very close to it appear throughout the website; this is the most consistently used color in the brand’s palette.
						<br>					
						The second image is a version of the brand’s logo, but in a purple/blue color.
						<br>
						Some of the branding (on the website and social media) features all capitalized type on posters, etc.
						<br>
						Some supplementary colors in the palette seem to be red, orange, and green.
						<br>
						The social media feed seems to be comprised of lots of photos and some graphics, but it doesn’t have an immediate visual theme; the posts don’t aesthetically convey the brand right away. The client appears to prioritize showing both the people who are serving meals and those being served. The overall brand identity could be pushed more through consistent inclusion of brand colors and graphics, while still including lots of photos to stay true to the client’s people-centered purpose.</p>
					<p>One thing that I noticed about the client is that the color of their logo varies across the site. At the top of the website, the logo is a light blue, but there is a purple/blue version of it further down on the page. The first lighter blue color is mostly consistent across branding, but the shades vary slightly if you look closely. One shade of this lighter blue needs to be solidified throughout the site, social media, etc. in order to maintain brand consistency. There are a lot of big sections of only text on the website, which makes these parts visually overwhelming. Visitors of the site are less likely to pay attention to the content when they see the big chunks of information. In addition, there are many typefaces used on the website, which can make it seem less organized.</p>
