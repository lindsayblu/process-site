					<p> <strong>Lisa Holland</strong><br><br>
						<em>Q: Why would you visit the Friendship Trays website?</em><br>
						A: To learn more about the organization and what they do. I would want to see if I’m in agreement with their mission and want to support them/tell my church about them.
							<br><br>

						<em>Q: What information about the organization is important to you?</em> <br>
						A: The organization’s mission and who they are serving. What drives them? Are their values in line with mine?
						<br><br>

						<em>Q: What specifically would you be looking for on the website?</em><br>
						A: Are they a Christian organization? If I agree with the mission, I might be looking for an online way to give.  <br><br>

						<em>Q: What would make you more likely to contribute to the cause?</em><br>
						A: Two factors would be a) if I agree with their cause and motivation and b) if I believe the people they are serving truly need the service and it is improving their lives. <br><br>
						
						
					


						<h3>Takeaways</h3>
						<p>From this interview, I learned that it will be important to display the organization’s mission and core values, as well as information about the people involved/running it. These interviews also confirmed that it will be helpful to include a donation button so it will be simple for visitors to donate once they determine whether or not they want to contribute to the organization.</p>
